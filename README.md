# Worker Safety Detection using YOLO

This project detects whether industrial workers are wearing:
- Helmet
- Safety vest

using a custom-trained YOLO model.

## Features
- Real-time CCTV detection
- Helmet and vest classification
- Bounding boxes and confidence score
- Can be deployed on edge or cloud

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- PyTorch

## Dataset
Custom annotated dataset using Roboflow / LabelImg.

## Model Training
The model was trained on helmet & vest labeled images for 50 epochs.
